                                        <h2>Archived Recreational Forecast</h2>
                                                    <h3>General:</h3>
            <p>Sun filtering through increasing high clouds this afternoon, except becoming mostly cloudy in New York and the St. Lawrence Valley late in the day. Highs in the low to mid 70s east, mid 70s to around 80 west. Light winds, variable to southeast, except from the east at around 10 mph in the St. Lawrence Valley.</p>
                                        <h3>Brief:</h3>
            <p>High pressure has nosed south into the region, keeping our skies mainly clear, and allowing the winds to slacken, ideal for producing some chilly readings just one week from the Summer Solstice.  The coldest mountain hollows north are flirting with a touch of frost, after some record high temperatures to start the week.  The high pressure area, centered to our north and beginning to weaken, will drift east today, permitting slightly warmer temperatures this afternoon, along with some high cirrus clouds, thickening west this afternoon.  The clouds will form in advance of a warm front lifting northeast from the Ohio Valley.  The clouds will thicken and lower overnight, leading to showers spreading into NY this evening, and moving into the rest of the region later tonight.  The warm front will take its time, leaving cool air in place through most of tomorrow, with highs remaining in the 60s.  The warmer, more humid air settles in for the weekend, with a few scattered, passing showers or a thunderstorm, but plenty of dry intervals to allow most of us to fit in our outdoor plans.  Temperatures will climb to the 70s to near 80 east, and into the 80s west Saturday, then 80s across the region Sunday, perhaps nudging 90 in the warmer valleys west.</p>
                                        <h3>Winds:</h3>
            <p>Winds today will be light, becoming southeast near 10 mph for areas west of the Green Mountains, with waves on the open waters of Lake Champlain near calm, increasing to near 1 foot.   Winds overnight mainly light and variable through eastern VT and NH, but increasing from the east and southeast 10 to 15 mph, some gusts to 30 mph from the Green Mountains west, with waves on the open waters of Lake Champlain building to 1 to 3 feet.  On Friday, south winds increasing to 10 to 25 mph, gusting to 35 mph from the Green Mountains west, and 10 to 15 mph in deeper valleys east, with waves on the open waters of Lake Champlain 3 to 5 feet.  The outlook for Saturday has south winds 10 to 15 mph.<br />

                                        <h3>Mountain:</h3>
            <p>The summits today will start with sunshine, mixing with some thin high clouds this afternoon.   Winds turning to the south, and temperatures moderating several degrees.  A warm front will bring lowering clouds later tonight into Friday morning, with the summits frequently in the clouds, along with scattered to numerous showers, and moderate to strong southwest winds.  Both Saturday and Sunday should offer variable clouds and sun, along with a few scattered showers or thunderstorms.  Temperatures warming into the 60s and 70s on moderate southwest winds.</p>

                    <p>The sunrise this morning, and again tomorrow morning, are the earliest of the year, even though we have not quite reached summer.  This slight discrepancy is due to our attempts to make time much more of a constant than it really is.  The Earth’s speed around the sun varies slightly during the year, going a little faster when we are closest to the sun in January, and a little slower now when we are a little farther away.  The Earth is still spinning just as fast, so the Sun comes up a little quicker.</p>
